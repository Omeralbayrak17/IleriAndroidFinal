# IleriAndroidFinal

Hi. This was my spring semester final project for advanced android programming. I used mvvm and rest api for getting data from internet and showing it in recycler view for users. 

I also used two different cardview for layouts.

Main branch is used for data.

Everything about code is in master branch.
